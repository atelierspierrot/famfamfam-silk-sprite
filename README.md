## Overview

[FamFamFam Silk web-icons set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/).
The original set of icons is proposed under
[Creative Commons "Attribution" license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/),

## Usage

### Installation

This package is a "standalone" CSS framework. To use it, you just need to get its sources
from GitHub and include the `src/` content of the package in your project assets.

If you are a [Bower](http://bower.io/) user, the package is registered so you can write
in your `bower.json`:

    "dependencies": {
        ...
        "atelierspierrot/famfamfam-silk-sprite": "dev-master"
    }

If you are a [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) user, the package is referenced to 
Packagist so you can write in your `composer.json`:

    "require": {
        ...
        "atelierspierrot/famfamfam-silk-sprite": "dev-master"
    }

### HTML usage

Once the package is included in your project, you can start to use the sprites framework.

To do so, you first need to include the CSS definitions:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/package/src/silk-icons-sprite.min.css" />

Then you can start writing some Silk icons spans using the framework explained below.

A demonstration page is available in the global package in `demo/` ; it shows in particular
the list of available icons and their names.

### CSS Framework

The package defines some **CSS sprite** classes to render some icons easily and with
least of work.

The CSS framework to use the sprites is based on two classes:

-   the first one to choose the icons size: `web-icon`,
-   the last one to choose the icon itself, which is the name of the icon.

For instance, to render a the "print" icon, you will write:

    <span class="web-icon print"></span>

As the sprite is not defined with restrictive CSS rules, you may encounter rendering
problems (such as margins or paddings defined globally in your document) that can be avoid
adding a `reset` class to your icons:

    <span class="web-icon reset print"></span>
